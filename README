== Intro ==

This is a repository dedicated to Gitshop, a "Git workshop" / presentations
series I do for Red Hat. You can find various materials in here, check out
the branches.

A quick (and possibly non-complete) index of branches:

- intro - you are here

- workshops - starting repo for the 'workshop' slide in each presentation

- slides - presentation slides

- videos - (currently) links to captured videos from the presentations,
           I may use some kind of "big file storage" mechanism later on

- 2012-* - an old (and incomplete) series I did back in 2012, for archival
           purposes only
